### Instructions:
1. Select a file by searching for it with the "Browse" button or try typing the absolute path to the file.
2. Once a file is chosen, the test drop-down list should auto populate itself with the available tests. Choose a test to extract data from.
3. After you select the test you will need to choose the trace you wish to view. If the current file contains multiple channels you will also need to select the channel.
4. If everything has gone accordingly there should be an averaged trace in the preview window. If you are satisfied with the result press the "Add To View" button. This will store the trace in the view window for later use.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 to add more traces to the view.
6. When you are finished or wish to start over from the beginning, press the "Reset View" button to empty the view. 

### TODO:
* Add Sparkle Average Analysis features to Sparkle Analysis
